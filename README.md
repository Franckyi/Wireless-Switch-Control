### Control your redstone signals easily !

Welcome to my new mod, Wireless Switch Control. This mod is still in development. It adds 2 new blocks in the game : the Redstone Switch and the Redstone Controller.

## New Blocks

* The Redstone Switch emits a configurable redstone signal. You can choose if it's enabled or not and how much power it emits in it's GUI. You can view it like a configurable Redstone Block. \

* The Redstone Controller lists all Redstone Switched linked to it. From this block GUI, you can control these switches. You can also unlink switches to this block. For the first release, one controller can only control up to 4 switches. \

## Linking Process

To link your controller to your switch, just select an empty slot in you hand, then Sneak + Right Click on the switch, and finally Sneak + Right Click on the controller. Notice that it only works in this order.

## Downloads

The mod is still in development. Backup your world before installing the mod (it probably won't uninstall the game... I think...).
